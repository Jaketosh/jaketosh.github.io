title: Week One (Aug. 28th)
---

This was the first week of Object Oriented Programming with Downing. As such, I would like to start my blog by answering a couple of questions:

<h4>What did I do this week?</h4>
This week was primarily based around setting a foundation for the class. We talked quite a bit about the syllabus and then progressed into talking about a few of the basic differences between Java and C++. We also took time on our second day of class to talk about unit tests and tools we could use inorder to ensure our tests were effectively evaluating our code.

The largest obstacle in my way at the moment is the reading. Many classes want their students to read this week and this class is no expection. We also have regular quizzing so it is important that I keep up with the reading and the online discussions.

title: What will I do next week?
---
My plan for the coming week is to keep up with the reading and hopefully start the first coding project if it is released. If the coding project is not released, then I will probably start looking at C++ tutorials and becoming more comfortable with that language since it will be what we program with all semester.

title: The Classroom Experience

My classroom experience so far has been quite positive. Professor Downing emphasizes the building of professional skills and toolsets. It is an incredibly pragmatic way to run the class which I really appreciate. The code examples in class have been very easy to follow and the one quiz we have had so far was very straight forward if you paid attention in the previous lecture. Overall I am very much looking forward to progressing in this class and seeing what Professor Downing has in store for us.

My link of the week is a tutorial about Git. The company I worked for this summer transitioned from Accurev to Git and I found that this tutorial was pretty simple and made learning git significantly easier. https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git
